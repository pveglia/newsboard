# newsboard

A website written in noir which has an interface that is somehow
similar to popular news aggregator
[hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com). It uses
[Redis](http://redis.io/) as a backend through
[carmine](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine).

## Usage

If you use cake, substitute 'lein' with 'cake' below. Everything should work fine.

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```
